    <!-- 
        - The Action Attribute

            The action attribute defines the action to be performed when the form is submitted. Usually, the form data is sent to a file on the server when the user clicks on the submit button.
        
            In the example below, the form data is sent to a file called "contact.php". This file contains a server-side script that handles the form data:

        - The Name Attributes

            Each field must have a name attributes to be submitted, If the name attribute is omitted, the value of the input field will not be sent at all.

        - The Target Attribute

            The target attribute specifies where to display the response that is received after submitting the form.

        - The Method Attribute

            The method attribute specifies the HTTP method to be used when submitting the form data.
            The form-data can be sent as URL variables (with method="get") or as HTTP post transaction (with method="post").
            The default HTTP method when submitting form data is GET. 


            Notes on GET:

            Appends the form data to the URL, in name/value pairs
            NEVER use GET to send sensitive data! (the submitted form data is visible in the URL!)
            The length of a URL is limited (2048 characters)
            Useful for form submissions where a user wants to bookmark the result
            GET is good for non-secure data, like query strings in Google


            Notes on POST:

            Appends the form data inside the body of the HTTP request (the submitted form data is not shown in the URL)
            POST has no size limitations, and can be used to send large amounts of data.
            Form submissions with POST cannot be bookmarked

        - The Autocomplete Attribute

            The autocomplete attribute specifies whether a form should have autocomplete on or off.
            When autocomplete is on, the browser automatically complete values based on values that the user has entered before.

    <form action="/contact.php" method="post"  autocomplete="off">
        <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
        <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" value="Sam"><br>
        <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
        <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" value="Bello"><br><br>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>
