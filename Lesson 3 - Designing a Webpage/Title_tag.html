        The <title> HTML element defines the document's title that is shown in a browser's title bar or a page's tab.

        The <title> tag is required in an HTML document and you cant have more than one <title> element in an HTML document.

        The contents of a page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO)! The page title is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages in search results.


        The <title> element:

        Defines a title in the browser toolbar
        Provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites
        Displays a title for the page in search-engine results


        Here are some tips for creating good titles:

        Go for a longer, descriptive title (avoid one- or two-word titles)
        Search engines will display about 50-60 characters of the title, so try not to have titles longer than that
        Do not use just a list of words as the title (this may reduce the page's position in search results)
        So, try to make the title as accurate and meaningful as possible!
